# project_of_presentation_project
This was one of my final projects for my Web Development classes. 

The purpose for this project was for it to be presented in a Web Dev Seminar to high school students. 
Using projects and code that I had done, to teach them the fundamental early skills to code on their own. 
This would serve not only as their first project, but the beginning of their own portfolio. As well they would 
be able to present this to their teachers and fellow classmates as their final Presentation Of Learning (POL).
